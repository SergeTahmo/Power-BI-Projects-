## Introduction  
This project involves the analysis of Mercedes-Benz vehicle sales using an interactive dashboard. The dataset covers transactions between 2022 and 2023. The analysis aims to examine vehicle pricing, sales performance across regions, customer demographics, model performance, engine types, and trends over time.

The following bullets list the insights I wished to derive:
*	What is the average price of Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold?
*	Which model and engine type were most purchased?
*	Which month had the highest sales?
*	How many units were sold per vehicle body style?
*	How are sales distributed across dealer regions?

Here’s what I did:

## Data Acquisition and Preparation  
The data was sourced internally and contains 16 columns:

`Car_id`, `Date`, `Customer Name`, `Gender`, `Annual Income`, `Dealer_Name`, `Company`, `Model`, `Engine`, `Transmission`, `Color`, `Price ($)`, `Dealer_No`, `Body Style`, `Phone`, `Dealer_Region`

These columns represent dealership activity, customer profiles, and vehicle characteristics for each sale.

## Data Cleaning  
I removed duplicate records using `Car_id` and `Date` as unique keys. The `Date` field was standardized and converted to date format. Categorical fields like `Gender`, `Engine`, and `Dealer_Region` were standardized to ensure consistency. The `Price ($)` column was cleaned and converted to a numeric format. Phone numbers were formatted correctly, and empty or missing values were reviewed and addressed.

## Data Processing  
The tool used to clean and process the dataset was **Power BI**. Power Query was used to apply transformations. I created new calculated columns for:

* Monthly and yearly breakdowns of sales  
* Model performance (unit sold and revenue)  
* Average price and price range  
* Groupings by region, engine, and body style

This prepared the data for dynamic analysis.

## Data Analysis and Visualization  
I used Power BI visualizations to build the dashboard as shown in Figure 1. The visuals included:

* Clustered Column Chart (monthly sales trend)  
* Donut Chart (vehicle body style breakdown)  
* Card Visuals (average price, top-selling model)  
* Bar Charts (engine type distribution, sales by region)  
* Slicers (filters by year, model, region, gender)

These visuals were combined into one interactive dashboard for stakeholders and dealership managers.

The figure below shows the dashboard which was built based on the analysis of the data.

## Data Interpretation  
This step allowed me to derive actionable insights:

* The average vehicle price was **$30.16K**, showing a premium pricing range.  
* The **M-Class** was the top-selling model with 123 units and $4M in revenue.  
* **SUVs** accounted for 57.72% of total sales, followed by Hatchbacks and Hardtops.  
* The majority of vehicles sold had an **Overhead Camshaft** engine (96 vs. 27 Double OHC).  
* The highest sales occurred in **December and October**, reflecting end-of-year buying trends.  
* Sales were distributed across **7 dealer regions**, indicating broad market presence.

## Recommendations  
The three top recommendations based on my analysis are:  
* Focus on promoting **M-Class and SUV models**, which drive the highest volume and revenue.  
* Plan sales campaigns around **Q4 (October–December)** to leverage seasonal demand.  
* Expand dealership reach in less represented regions to unlock additional market share.
